# N0lan

[N0lan](https://n0lan.com) helps you read, write, and understand code. Currently, N0lan can answer questions, explain code, generate documentation, and calculate the time complexity of functions.

## Explain Code

Having trouble understanding the program that you're looking at? Use `Explain Code` to explain it to you in natural language.

## Translate languages

Translate code using `Language translator` to translate code from one programming language into another

## Write Docstring

Don't like writing documentation for your functions? Have N0lan's `Docstring Writer` craft detailed docstrings so your functions are always readable and maintable.

## Calculate Time Complexity

Measure the efficiency of your code in Big O notation using `Time Complexity` and see how you can optimize your program.

## Deploying Locally

1. Install all dependencies using `npm install`
2. Rename `client/.env.example` into `client/.env`, `server/.env.example` into `server/.env` and populate all missing environment variables
3. Run `npm run dev`
