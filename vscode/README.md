[Figstack](https://figstack.com) helps you read, write, and understand code. Currently, Figstack can answer questions, explain code, generate documentation, and calculate the time complexity of functions.

## Ask Questions

Use the `Ask Question` function to get answers about your code as if you are asking a programming instructor.

## Explain Code

Having trouble understanding the program that you're looking at? Use `Explain Code` to explain it to you in natural language.

## Write Docstring

Don't like writing documentation for your functions? Have Figstack's `Docstring Writer` craft detailed docstrings so your functions are always readable and maintable.

## Calculate Time Complexity

Measure the efficiency of your code in Big O notation using `Time Complexity` and see how you can optimize your program.
